Based on the provided microservice design and user stories, here is an expansion of the software functionalities into a complete set of requirements for the Java microservice application:

**Microservice: User Management**

1. **Authentication Service (Microservice 1)**
    - **Endpoints:**
        - `POST /users/login`: Authenticates users by verifying credentials.
    - **Functionalities:**
        - Validate user credentials (username and password).
        - Check if the user account is active and not blocked.
        - Generate and return an authentication token (e.g., JWT) upon successful login.
        - Provide meaningful error messages on authentication failure.
    - **Sample JSON request/response:**
        - Request: `{"username": "johndoe", "password": "SecurePass123"}`
        - Response: `{"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR..."}`

2. **User Account Management Service (Microservice 2)**
    - **Endpoints:**
        - `POST /users`: Creates a new user account.
        - `GET /users/{userId}`: Retrieves user information.
        - `PUT /users/{userId}`: Updates user information.
        - `DELETE /users/{userId}`: Deletes a user account.
    - **Functionalities:**
        - Create new customer or employee accounts with validation of input data.
        - Retrieve personal information of a user.
        - Update personal information, ensuring proper validation and authorization.
        - Delete a user account, ensuring all related data is handled according to data retention policies.
    - **Sample JSON request/response:**
        - Create Request: `{"username": "johndoe", "password": "SecurePass123", "role": "customer", ...}`
        - Create Response: `{"userId": "12345", "status": "Account created successfully."}`

3. **Customer Management Service (Microservice 3)**
    - **Endpoints:**
        - `POST /customers`: Creates a new customer account with a linked card.
        - `PUT /customers/{customerId}`: Updates customer information.
    - **Functionalities:**
        - Handle new customer additions, ensuring data validity and unique ID generation.
        - Update customer information with proper validation checks.
        - Create a library card entity linked to the customer on account creation.
    - **Sample JSON request/response:**
        - Create Request: `{"fullName": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com", ...}`
        - Create Response: `{"customerId": "CUST12345", "cardId": "CARD67890", "status": "Customer created successfully."}`

**Technical Considerations:**

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):**
    - Organize code into bounded contexts corresponding to 'User Management', 'Authentication', and 'Customer Management'.
    - Define Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, Repositories, and Services within each bounded context.

- **Scalability, Performance, and Security:**
    - Use appropriate database indexing to speed up queries.
    - Implement caching where necessary to improve performance.
    - Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization checks.
    - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

- **Exception Handling, Validation, and Logging:**
    - Implement global exception handling to capture and respond to unexpected conditions.
    - Use validation annotations and custom validators to ensure input data meets business rules.
    - Log key actions and errors to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

- **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for each service method, controller, and utility class.
    - Use Mocks and Stubs to isolate tests from external dependencies.

- **API Documentation:**
    - Document each API endpoint with OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Integrate with a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack).
    - Include metrics and health checks for monitoring the services.

- **CI/CD:**
    - Set up pipelines for continuous integration and continuous deployment using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

- **Additional Features:**
    - Implement an event-driven architecture where appropriate to handle operations like user creation, updates, and deletions.
    - Plan for data migration strategies to handle changes in the database schema.
    - Ensure data consistency and integrity across microservices.

This comprehensive design will guide the development of the microservice application, ensuring that all user stories are addressed and the system is robust, scalable, and maintainable.
