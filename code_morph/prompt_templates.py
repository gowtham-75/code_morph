You are tasked with analyzing a complex legacy PLSQL codebase to generate an English explanation of its business rules 
and logic. This analysis will be used to create requirements documents for redesigning the system in a modern language 
like Java. Your goal is to extract and explain the key elements of the code in a clear, concise manner.

Here is the PLSQL code to analyze:

<plsql_code>
    {PLSQL_CODE}
</plsql_code>

Carefully examine the provided PLSQL code and generate a comprehensive explanation of its functionality, business rules, 
and logic. Your output should be in a bullet point format, organized into the following sections:

1. Overview
   - Name of the script or module.
   - Provide a brief summary of the code's main purpose and functionality.

2. Key Components
   - List and explain the main procedures, functions, and packages in the code.
   - Describe the purpose of each component.

3. Business Rules
   - Identify and explain any business rules implemented in the code.
   - Include conditions, validations, and constraints.

4. Data Flow
   - Describe how data moves through the system.
   - Explain any data transformations or calculations.

5. Error Handling and Exceptions
   - List any error handling mechanisms or custom exceptions.
   - Explain how errors are managed and reported.

6. Database Interactions
   - Describe any database operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
   - Explain the purpose of these operations in the context of the business logic.

7. Integration Points
   - Identify any external system interactions or API calls.
   - Explain the purpose of these integrations.

8. Performance Considerations
   - Highlight any performance-related code, such as bulk operations or optimizations.

9. Business Logic Summary
   - Provide a concise summary of the overall business logic implemented in the code.

10. Additional Notes
    - Include any observations, potential issues, or recommendations for the redesign process.

When analyzing the code:
- If you encounter complex or unclear sections, provide your best interpretation and note any assumptions made.
- Use clear, non-technical language where possible to explain technical concepts.
- If you identify any potential issues or areas for improvement, include these in your notes.

Remember to focus on extracting the business logic and rules, rather than providing a line-by-line code explanation. 
Your analysis should help developers understand the core functionality and business requirements implemented in this 
PLSQL code, facilitating its redesign in a modern language.

Please also output the word *END* at the end of your response to indicate completion.

You are tasked with generating Java/Spring Boot code from legacy PLSQL code, modernizing it into a microservices 
architecture using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts. Your goal is to create a fully object-oriented codebase that is 
well-structured and follows best practices for Spring Boot applications.

First, analyze the provided PLSQL code:

<plsql_code>
    {PLSQL_CODE}
</plsql_code>

Follow these steps to convert the PLSQL code to Java/Spring Boot:

1. Identify the main functionalities and data structures in the PLSQL code.
2. Map PLSQL procedures and functions to Java methods.
3. Convert PLSQL data types to appropriate Java data types.
4. Replace PLSQL-specific constructs with Java equivalents.
5. Implement database operations using Spring Data JPA or JDBC Template.

Apply DDD concepts and microservices architecture:

1. Identify bounded contexts within the functionality.
2. Create separate microservices for each bounded context.
3. Define domain entities, value objects, and aggregates.
4. Implement repositories for data access.
5. Use domain events for communication between microservices.

Organize your code following these guidelines:

1. Use a layered architecture: Controller, Service, Repository.
2. Create separate packages for each layer and domain concept.
3. Implement dependency injection using Spring annotations.
4. Use interfaces to define contracts between layers.
5. Apply SOLID principles throughout your code.

Provide your output in the following format:

<java_code>
// Package declaration
package com.example.microservice;

// Import statements

// Class declarations, including annotations

// Method implementations
</java_code>

Include comments explaining the purpose of each class and method, especially where complex logic is involved.

Remember to handle errors appropriately and include unit tests for your Java code. Also, consider implementing API 
documentation using Swagger or Spring REST Docs.

Your final output should include multiple Java files representing the different components of the microservices 
architecture, along with a brief explanation of how the code is organized and how it implements the DDD concepts.

Please also output the word *END* at the end of your response to indicate completion.

You are tasked with modernizing a complex legacy PLSQL codebase to modern Java and Spring Boot microservices. Your goal 
is to generate an object-oriented design from the PLSQL code using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to break the 
design into microservices. You will also create a Mermaid component diagram to visualize the architecture.

Here is the PLSQL code you need to analyze:

<plsql_code>
    {PLSQL_CODE}
</plsql_code>

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Analyze the PLSQL code:
   a. Identify the main functionalities and business logic in the code.
   b. Determine the data structures and their relationships.
   c. Recognize any existing modules or logical separations in the code.

2. Apply Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles:
   a. Identify the core domain and subdomains based on the business logic in the PLSQL code.
   b. Define bounded contexts for each subdomain.
   c. Identify entities, value objects, and aggregates within each bounded context.
   d. Determine the domain events and commands.

3. Design microservices:
   a. Map each bounded context to a potential microservice.
   b. Ensure each microservice has a single responsibility and is loosely coupled.
   c. Define the APIs for each microservice, including endpoints and data contracts.
   d. Identify shared libraries or common functionalities that can be extracted.

4. Create a Mermaid component diagram:
   a. Represent each microservice as a component.
   b. Show the relationships and dependencies between microservices.
   c. Include external systems or databases if applicable.
   d. Use appropriate Mermaid syntax for component diagrams.

5. Provide your output in the following format:
   a. Start with a brief overview of the identified domains and subdomains.
   b. List each microservice with its responsibilities and main entities.
   c. Describe the APIs for each microservice.
   d. Include the Mermaid component diagram code.
   e. Conclude with any additional considerations or recommendations for the modernization process.

Enclose your entire response within <answer> tags. Use appropriate subheadings to organize your response clearly. 
Present the Mermaid diagram code within <mermaid> tags.

Remember to focus on creating a clean, modular design that adheres to DDD principles and microservices architecture 
best practices. Your design should aim to improve maintainability, scalability, and flexibility compared to the original
 PLSQL codebase.
