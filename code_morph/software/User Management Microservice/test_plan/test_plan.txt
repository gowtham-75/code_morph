# Software Test Plan for User Management Service

## 1. Introduction
This test plan outlines the testing strategy and approach for the User Management Service, a Java microservice application designed to handle user authentication, retrieval, update, creation, and deletion. The plan ensures that all functionalities align with the principles of Domain-Driven Design, RESTful APIs, and microservices best practices.

## 2. Test Objectives
- **Functionality**: To verify that all API endpoints perform as expected according to the requirements.
- **Security**: To ensure that user data is protected, and the authentication mechanism is secure.
- **Performance**: To test the responsiveness and stability of the service under various loads.
- **Usability**: To confirm that API endpoints are user-friendly and well-documented.
- **Compatibility**: To ensure the service works across different environments and databases.
- **Error Handling**: To verify that the service handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful messages.

## 3. Test Items
- Authentication (POST /users/login)
- User Retrieval (GET /users/{userId})
- User Update (PUT /users/{userId})
- User Creation (POST /users)
- User Deletion (DELETE /users/{userId})

## 4. Test Environment
- **Development**: Local development machines with Java, IDE, and necessary tools.
- **Staging**: An environment that mimics the production setup.
- **Production**: The live environment where the service will be deployed.

## 5. Test Criteria
- **Pass Criteria**: All test cases pass, the software performs as expected, and meets the performance benchmarks.
- **Fail Criteria**: Any critical test cases fail or the software does not meet the performance benchmarks.

## 6. Test Deliverables
- Test plan document
- Test cases and scripts
- Test results and reports
- Defect reports
- Test summary report

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Unit Testing
- Perform unit tests for each layer (Controller, Service, Repository, Domain).
- Mock dependencies using frameworks like Mockito.

### 7.2 Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints using tools like Postman or automated scripts.
- Verify the interaction between layers and the database.

### 7.3 Security Testing
- Test for authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Check for encryption of sensitive data.

### 7.4 Performance Testing
- Use tools like JMeter to simulate load on the service.
- Monitor response times and system resources.

### 7.5 Regression Testing
- Run the full test suite after each significant change to the codebase.

### 7.6 Acceptance Testing
- Validate the system against user stories and requirements.

## 8. Test Cases

### 8.1 Authentication (POST /users/login)
- **TC1**: Valid credentials
- **TC2**: Invalid username
- **TC3**: Invalid password
- **TC4**: Empty username or password

### 8.2 User Retrieval (GET /users/{userId})
- **TC5**: Valid user ID
- **TC6**: Non-existent user ID
- **TC7**: Invalid user ID format

### 8.3 User Update (PUT /users/{userId})
- **TC8**: Valid update request
- **TC9**: Update non-existent user
- **TC10**: Update with invalid data

### 8.4 User Creation (POST /users)
- **TC11**: Valid creation request
- **TC12**: Create user with existing username
- **TC13**: Create user with invalid data

### 8.5 User Deletion (DELETE /users/{userId})
- **TC14**: Valid deletion request
- **TC15**: Delete non-existent user
- **TC16**: Invalid user ID format

## 9. Testing Schedule
- **Unit Testing**: Concurrent with development.
- **Integration and Security Testing**: After the completion of unit testing.
- **Performance Testing**: After integration testing.
- **Regression and Acceptance Testing**: Prior to release.

## 10. Risks and Mitigations
- **Incomplete requirements**: Work closely with stakeholders to clarify requirements.
- **Third-party service failures**: Implement fallback mechanisms and retries.
- **Resource constraints**: Plan for adequate resources and time for testing.

## 11. Approvals
- QA Lead
- Project Manager
- Stakeholders

This test plan is designed to ensure a thorough and efficient testing process, covering all critical aspects of the User Management Service. The test cases provided are a representative sample and should be expanded upon as needed to cover additional scenarios and edge cases.
