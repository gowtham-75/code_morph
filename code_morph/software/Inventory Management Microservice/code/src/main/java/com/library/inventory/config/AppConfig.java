```java
package com.library.inventory.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.library.inventory")
public class AppConfig {

    // Define any beans that are required for the application here
    // For example, if you need to configure a bean for a service or a repository, you can do it as follows:
    /*
    @Bean
    public SomeService someService() {
        return new SomeServiceImpl();
    }
    */

    // Note: Since this is a simple configuration file and there are no specific beans to configure as per the given description,
    // the class is left mostly empty. You can add bean configurations as needed for your specific use case.
