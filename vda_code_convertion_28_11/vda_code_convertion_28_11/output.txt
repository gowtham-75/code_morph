Title: Order Submission Process

User Story: As a customer, I want to submit orders so that I can purchase products online.

Description: The PL/SQL script submit_order.sql handles the process of submitting an order. It begins by validating customer existence and shipping address, then creates a new order record with 'Pending' status. It iterates over each item in the customer's temporary order, checking stock availability, applying category-based discounts, calculating line amounts, and updating product stock. The script applies a total amount-based discount, loyalty points discount, and coupon discount if applicable. It also calculates tax and shipping cost, updates the order's total amount, and commits the transaction. If any exceptions arise, such as out-of-stock items or invalid customer data, the transaction is rolled back.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given a customer's order, when the order is submitted, then validate the customer's existence and shipping address.
Given line items in the order, when processing the order, then check stock availability and apply discounts.
Given the total amount of the order, when discounts are applicable, then apply the discounts according to business rules.
Given the final amount, when the order is ready to be finalized, then calculate tax and shipping cost.
Given a successful transaction, when all validations and calculations are done, then commit the order to the database.
Given any exception during the order processing, when an error condition is met, then rollback the transaction and provide an error message.
Technical Notes:
