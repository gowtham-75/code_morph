Based on the provided microservice design and user stories, here is an expanded description of the software along with the complete set of functionalities needed to get the software to work:

### Microservice: User Management Service

#### Core Entities:
- Customer
- Employee
- Card

#### Service Layers:
1. **Controller Layer** - Handles HTTP requests and responses.
2. **Service Layer** - Contains business logic.
3. **Repository Layer** - Handles data persistence.
4. **Domain Layer** - Contains domain models and validation logic.

#### API Endpoints and Functionalities:

1. **Authentication:**
   - `POST /users/login`:
     - Input: JSON with username and password.
     - Function: Authenticate users by checking credentials.
     - Response: JSON with authentication status and user details/token on success.

2. **User Retrieval:**
   - `GET /users/{userId}`:
     - Function: Retrieve user information by ID.
     - Response: JSON with user details.

3. **User Update:**
   - `PUT /users/{userId}`:
     - Input: JSON with user details to be updated.
     - Function: Update user information.
     - Response: JSON with updated user details or an error message.

4. **User Creation:**
   - `POST /users`:
     - Input: JSON with new user details.
     - Function: Create a new user account.
     - Response: JSON with created user details.

5. **User Deletion:**
   - `DELETE /users/{userId}`:
     - Function: Delete a user account.
     - Response: JSON with a confirmation of deletion.

#### Additional Functionalities:

- **Security:**
  - Implement OAuth2 or JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
  - Encrypt sensitive data like passwords.
  - Use HTTPS for API endpoints.

- **Scalability:**
  - Design services to be stateless.
  - Use a load balancer to distribute traffic.
  - Implement database sharding if necessary.

- **Performance:**
  - Optimize database queries.
  - Use caching mechanisms where appropriate.

- **Exception Handling:**
  - Provide meaningful error messages.
  - Use a global exception handler.

- **Validation:**
  - Validate input data in the domain layer.
  - Use custom validators for complex validation rules.

- **Logging:**
  - Log all requests and responses.
  - Log errors and exceptions.

- **Monitoring:**
  - Implement health checks for microservices.
  - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

- **Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for each layer.
  - Write integration tests for API endpoints.

- **API Documentation:**
  - Use Swagger or OpenAPI for documenting the API.

- **CI/CD:**
  - Set up pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.

- **Event-Driven Architecture:**
  - Use messaging queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous communication between microservices.

- **Data Migration:**
  - Design a strategy for migrating existing data to the new microservices architecture.

#### Sample JSON Request/Response for User Stories:

- **Authentication Service (User Story 001):**
  - Request: `{"username": "user1", "password": "pass123"}`
  - Response: `{"status": "success", "message": "Authentication successful", "token": "abc123xyz"}`
  
- **Customer Management Service (User Story 006):**
  - Request: `{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com", "address": "123 Main St" }`
  - Response: `{"customerId": "CUST12345", "cardId": "CARD67890", "status": "active"}`

This complete software design provides a high-level overview of the functionalities needed for the Java microservice application, aligning with the principles of Domain-Driven Design, RESTful APIs, and microservices best practices.
