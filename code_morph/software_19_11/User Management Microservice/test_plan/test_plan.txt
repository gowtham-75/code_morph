# Software Test Plan for User Management Microservice

## 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the strategy, scope, resources, schedule, and activities required to ensure the quality of the User Management Microservice application. The application consists of three key services: Authentication Service, User Account Management Service, and Customer Management Service.

## 2. Test Objectives

- To ensure that the application meets the functional requirements as outlined in the software description.
- To validate the performance, security, and scalability aspects of the application.
- To verify that the application adheres to best practices in domain-driven design, exception handling, validation, logging, and API documentation.

## 3. Scope

The scope of testing will cover all the endpoints and functionalities of the three microservices, including:

- Authentication workflows
- User account creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
- Customer account creation and update
- Validation of input data
- Error handling and meaningful error messages
- Token generation and handling
- API security, including HTTPS, authentication, and authorization

## 4. Test Strategy

The test strategy will include:

- Unit testing for individual components
- Integration testing for service interactions
- System testing for end-to-end workflows
- Security testing for authorization and authentication mechanisms
- Performance testing for load handling and response times
- Regression testing for ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionalities

## 5. Test Environment

The testing will be conducted in an environment that mimics the production setup with isolated services, databases, and network configurations.

## 6. Test Data

Test data will be generated to cover all possible input scenarios, including valid, invalid, and boundary cases.

## 7. Test Cases

### Authentication Service (Microservice 1)

**TC1: Valid Login**
- **Objective**: Test a user can log in with valid credentials.
- **Input**: Valid `username` and `password`.
- **Expected Result**: Authentication token is returned.

**TC2: Invalid Login**
- **Objective**: Test the system's response to invalid login attempts.
- **Input**: Invalid `username` and/or `password`.
- **Expected Result**: Error message indicating invalid credentials.

**TC3: Blocked Account Login**
- **Objective**: Test login with a blocked user account.
- **Input**: Credentials for a blocked account.
- **Expected Result**: Error message indicating the account is blocked.

### User Account Management Service (Microservice 2)

**TC4: Create User Account**
- **Objective**: Test creating a new user account with valid data.
- **Input**: Valid user data including `username`, `password`, and `role`.
- **Expected Result**: Success response with `userId`.

**TC5: Retrieve User Account**
- **Objective**: Test retrieving an existing user account.
- **Input**: Valid `userId`.
- **Expected Result**: User information is returned.

**TC6: Update User Account**
- **Objective**: Test updating user information with proper authorization.
- **Input**: Valid `userId` and updated information.
- **Expected Result**: Success message and updated information.

**TC7: Delete User Account**
- **Objective**: Test deletion of a user account.
- **Input**: Valid `userId`.
- **Expected Result**: Success message and confirmation of deletion.

### Customer Management Service (Microservice 3)

**TC8: Create Customer Account**
- **Objective**: Test creating a new customer account with valid data.
- **Input**: Valid customer data including `fullName`, `email`, etc.
- **Expected Result**: Success response with `customerId` and `cardId`.

**TC9: Update Customer Information**
- **Objective**: Test updating existing customer information.
- **Input**: Valid `customerId` and updated information.
- **Expected Result**: Success message and updated information.

## 8. Entry and Exit Criteria

**Entry Criteria**:
- All microservices are deployed in the test environment.
- Test cases and test data are prepared and reviewed.

**Exit Criteria**:
- All test cases have been executed.
- All critical and major defects have been fixed and retested.
- Performance metrics meet the acceptance criteria.

## 9. Tools and Resources

- Testing Framework: JUnit, Mockito
- Performance Testing: JMeter
- Security Testing: OWASP ZAP
- API Documentation: Swagger UI
- CI/CD: Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions
- Version Control: Git

## 10. Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: Integration issues between microservices.
**Mitigation**: Ensure thorough integration testing and end-to-end testing.

**Risk**: Performance bottlenecks under high load.
**Mitigation**: Conduct performance testing and optimize code and infrastructure accordingly.

**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities.
**Mitigation**: Perform security testing and code reviews to identify and fix security issues.

## 11. Schedule

The testing activities will be scheduled according to the project timeline, with milestones for completion of unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and final acceptance testing.

## 12. Approval

The test plan must be approved by the project manager, development lead, and QA lead before testing activities commence.
