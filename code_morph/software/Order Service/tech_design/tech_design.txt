### Detailed Architecture and Design for the Java Microservice Application

#### Microservices Overview

1. **Order Management Microservice**: This microservice handles the core business logic related to orders. It is responsible for order validation, creation, and modification. It interacts with other microservices for fetching product details, customer information, and coupon data.

#### Microservice Responsibilities and Interactions

- **Order Management Microservice**:
  - **Order Validation**: Validates the incoming order data against business rules and data integrity checks.
  - **Order and Customer Details Fetching**: Communicates with Customer and Product microservices to retrieve necessary details.
  - **Order Creation and Modification**: Handles the creation of new orders and the modification of existing ones, ensuring transactional integrity.

#### Classes, Methods, and Attributes

- **Order Management Microservice**:
  - **Classes**:
    - `OrderService`: Manages order operations.
    - `OrderController`: REST API controller to handle HTTP requests.
    - `Order`: Domain entity representing an order.
    - `OrderItem`: Domain entity representing an item within an order.
    - `OrderRepository`: Interface for database operations related to orders.
  - **Methods**:
    - `createOrder(Order order)`: Validates and creates a new order.
    - `modifyOrder(Long orderId, Order order)`: Modifies an existing order.
    - `getOrderById(Long orderId)`: Retrieves an order by its ID.
  - **Attributes**:
    - `List<OrderItem> items`: Items in the order.
    - `Customer customer`: Customer who placed the order.
    - `BigDecimal totalAmount`: Total amount of the order.

#### APIs (REST Endpoints)

- **Order Management Microservice**:
  - `POST /orders`: Creates a new order.
    - Request: JSON containing order details.
    - Response: JSON with created order information.
  - `GET /orders/{id}`: Retrieves an order by ID.
    - Response: JSON with order details.
  - `PUT /orders/{id}/modify`: Modifies an existing order.
    - Request: JSON with modifications.
    - Response: JSON with updated order details.

#### Database Schema Design

- **Order Management Microservice**:
  - **Entities**:
    - `Order`: Represents customer orders.
      - Attributes: id, customer_id, total_amount, status, etc.
    - `OrderItem`: Represents items within an order.
      - Attributes: id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price, etc.
  - **Relationships**:
    - One `Order` has many `OrderItems`.

#### Integration with External Systems

- Integration with Product, Customer, and Coupon microservices for data retrieval and validation.

#### Key Configurations for Spring Boot

- `application.properties` for database configurations, server port, etc.
- Service discovery using Netflix Eureka or Spring Cloud Discovery.

#### Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Authentication**: Use Spring Security for securing endpoints.
- **Logging**: Implement centralized logging with Spring Cloud Sleuth or ELK stack.
- **Monitoring**: Use Spring Boot Actuator and Prometheus for application monitoring.

#### Testing Approach

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components using JUnit and Mockito.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components and with the database using Spring Boot Test.

#### CI/CD Pipelines

- Use Jenkins or GitLab CI for continuous integration and deployment.
- Automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

    class OrderService {
        +createOrder(Order order)
        +modifyOrder(Long orderId, Order order)
        +getOrderById(Long orderId)
    }
    class OrderController {
        +createOrder()
        +getOrderById()
        +modifyOrder()
    }
    class Order {
        -List items
        -Customer customer
        -BigDecimal totalAmount
    }
    class OrderItem {
        -Long productId
        -int quantity
        -BigDecimal price
    }
    class OrderRepository {
        <<interface>>
        +save(Order order)
        +findById(Long id)
        +deleteById(Long id)
    }

    OrderController --> OrderService : uses
    OrderService --> OrderRepository : uses
    Order --> OrderItem : contains
```

#### Sequence Diagram

    participant Client
    participant OrderController
    participant OrderService
    participant OrderRepository

    Client->>OrderController: POST /orders (order data)
    OrderController->>OrderService: createOrder(order)
    OrderService->>OrderRepository: save(order)
    OrderRepository-->>OrderService: orderSaved
    OrderService-->>OrderController: orderDTO
    OrderController-->>Client: orderResponse (201 Created)
```

This high-level design and explanation of components provide a blueprint for building the Java microservice application according to the provided microservice design and user stories. Actual implementation would require further detail and coding according to the Spring Boot framework and DDD principles.
