Based on the provided microservice design and user stories, I will outline a complete set of functionalities for an Order Management microservice application. This design will follow microservices architecture principles and will be implemented using Spring Boot, adhering to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

### Microservice Application Overview:

#### Order Management Microservice:
- **Subdomain**: Order Management
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Order validation
  - Order and customer details fetching
  - Order creation and modification
- **Main Entities**:
  - Order
  - OrderItem
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /orders`: Create a new order
  - `GET /orders/{id}`: Retrieve an order
  - `PUT /orders/{id}/modify`: Modify an existing order
- **Additional Considerations**:
  - Ensure transactional integrity and eventual consistency
  - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Consider using an API Gateway
  - Use asynchronous communication for inter-service communication
  - Implement security best practices

#### Functionalities and Modules:

1. **Order Validation Module**:
   - Validate incoming order data against business rules.
   - Check for the existence of customer ID and order items in their respective data stores.
   - Ensure non-null shipping address.
   - Validate loyalty points and coupon codes.
   - Calculate the total amount, including discounts, taxes, and shipping costs.
   - Perform stock checks and update stock levels.
   - Commit or rollback transactions based on validation results.

2. **Order Creation Module**:
   - Provide an endpoint to create orders (`POST /orders`).
   - Ensure all required fields are present and valid.
   - Calculate the initial total amount before applying discounts.
   - Apply discounts, loyalty points, and coupon discounts.
   - Calculate taxes and shipping costs.
   - Persist the order to the data store.

3. **Order Modification Module**:
   - Provide an endpoint to modify existing orders (`PUT /orders/{id}/modify`).
   - Allow changes to order items, quantities, and shipping address.
   - Recalculate the total amount after modifications.
   - Update the order details in the data store.

4. **Order Retrieval Module**:
   - Provide an endpoint to retrieve order details (`GET /orders/{id}`).
   - Fetch order and customer details from the data store.
   - Return order details in JSON format.

5. **Exception Handling and Logging Module**:
   - Implement global exception handling.
   - Log exceptions and important events throughout the application.
   - Provide meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes.

6. **Security Module**:
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Secure API endpoints using security best practices (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
   - Ensure sensitive data is encrypted and handled securely.

7. **Unit Testing Module**:
   - Write unit tests for each feature and module.
   - Ensure code coverage meets the project's requirements.
   - Mock external dependencies and services for testing purposes.

#### Sample JSON Request/Response:

- **Create Order Request**:
  ```json
  {
    "customerId": "CUST123",
    "items": [
      {
        "productId": "PROD456",
        "quantity": 2
      }
    ],
    "shippingAddress": "123 Main St, Anytown, AN",
    "couponCode": "DISCOUNT10"
  }
  ```

- **Create Order Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "orderId": "ORD789",
    "customerId": "CUST123",
    "items": [
      {
        "productId": "PROD456",
        "quantity": 2,
        "unitPrice": 29.99,
        "totalPrice": 59.98
      }
    ],
    "subTotal": 59.98,
    "discounts": 5.99,
    "tax": 4.20,
    "shippingCost": 10.00,
    "totalAmount": 68.19,
    "status": "CONFIRMED"
  }
  ```

### Additional Design Considerations:

- **Data Store Integration**: Integrate with databases or data stores to manage orders, products, customers, and coupons.
- **Scalability**: Design the application to handle increasing loads by using load balancers and ensuring stateless services.
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries and use caching where appropriate to improve response times.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Use messaging queues or event streams for communication between microservices to enhance performance and reliability.
- **API Gateway**: Implement an API gateway to route requests, handle cross-cutting concerns, and provide a single entry point for the client applications.
- **Monitoring and Health Checks**: Implement monitoring and health check endpoints to ensure the microservice is functioning correctly and to facilitate quick issue resolution.

This design provides a comprehensive blueprint for the Order Management microservice application, addressing the key requirements and considerations outlined in the initial description.
