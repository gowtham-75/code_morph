# Software Test Plan for Order Management Microservice

## 1. Test Plan Introduction
This test plan outlines the strategy and approach for validating the functionality, performance, security, and reliability of the Order Management microservice application. The microservice is designed using Spring Boot and follows Domain-Driven Design principles.

## 2. Test Objectives
- To ensure that the microservice accurately performs order validation, creation, modification, and retrieval.
- To verify that the system maintains transactional integrity and eventual consistency.
- To validate the robustness of error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- To confirm security measures are effective and data is handled securely.
- To assess the performance and scalability of the application under load.

## 3. Test Items
- Order Validation Module
- Order Creation Module
- Order Modification Module
- Order Retrieval Module
- Exception Handling and Logging Module
- Security Module
- Unit Testing Module

## 4. Features to be Tested
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Order creation process and data persistence
- Order modification logic and data persistence
- Order retrieval accuracy and response format
- Exception handling and logging correctness
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Integration with external services (e.g., databases, messaging queues)

## 5. Features Not to be Tested
- Third-party services (e.g., database internals, messaging queue internals)
- Load balancer and API Gateway (assumed to be tested separately)

## 6. Approach
- Functional testing to validate each endpoint against the user stories.
- Integration testing to ensure modules work together correctly.
- Performance testing to simulate varying loads.
- Security testing to validate authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
- Unit testing for individual components with mocked dependencies.

## 7. Pass/Fail Criteria
- All test cases must pass without critical bugs.
- Performance benchmarks must be met or exceeded.
- No security vulnerabilities should be present.

## 8. Test Deliverables
- Test plan document
- Test cases and scripts
- Test results and reports
- Defect reports
- Performance testing reports
- Security testing reports

## 9. Test Environment
- Test server with a configuration similar to the production environment.
- Separate instances of databases and messaging queues.
- Tools for REST API testing (e.g., Postman, JMeter).
- Security testing tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite).

## 10. Test Schedule
- Test planning and design: 1 week
- Test environment setup: 2 days
- Test execution: 2 weeks
- Test evaluation and reporting: 1 week

## 11. Risks and Contingencies
- In case of delays, prioritize critical test cases.
- If critical bugs are found, reassess the release schedule.

## 12. Test Cases

### Order Validation Module
- TC01: Validate a new order with correct data.
- TC02: Validate an order with missing customer ID.
- TC03: Validate an order with invalid coupon code.
- TC04: Validate an order with insufficient stock.

### Order Creation Module
- TC05: Create a new order and verify database entry.
- TC06: Create an order with invalid data and expect failure.
- TC07: Create an order and verify the response against the request.

### Order Modification Module
- TC08: Modify an existing order and verify the update.
- TC09: Attempt to modify a non-existent order.
- TC10: Modify an order with invalid data and expect failure.

### Order Retrieval Module
- TC11: Retrieve an existing order and verify the response.
- TC12: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent order.

### Exception Handling and Logging Module
- TC13: Trigger an exception and verify the log entry.
- TC14: Verify meaningful error messages for client errors.

### Security Module
- TC15: Attempt to access API without authentication.
- TC16: Access API with proper authentication and verify the response.

### Performance Testing
- TC17: Simulate a high number of concurrent orders to test scalability.
- TC18: Measure response times under normal and peak loads.

### Security Testing
- TC19: Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- TC20: Test encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.

This test plan provides a structured approach to validate the Order Management microservice. It should be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and new features are added.
